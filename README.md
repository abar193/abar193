Hi! I'm Anton. 

I worked as an enterprise Java developer, doing boring stuff the hard way, and most of my code will never be seen by anyone, 
who hasn't signed an NDA. (That's probably for the best!)

Nowadays I joined start-up [Teya](https://teya.com/) and I even have a second [GitHub profile](https://github.com/abar-teya).

I use this GitHub as a free hosting for my personal blog [https://mrabar.me/](https://mrabar.me/)
