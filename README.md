Hi! I'm Anton. 

I work as an enterprise Java developer, doing boring stuff the hard way, and most of my code will never be seen by anyone, 
who hasn't signed an NDA. (That's probably for the best!)

I use GitHub as a free hosting for my personal blog [https://mrabar.me/](https://mrabar.me/)

You may want to check out my OS projects:

- Hackaton submission [Batman Anti Money Laundering](https://github.com/abar193/batman-aml)
- Java 17, Quarkus, QueryDSL app with Github OIDC [Replayka](https://github.com/abar193/replayka) (PoC for blog analytics on free hostings)
